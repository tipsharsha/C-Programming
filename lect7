User defined functions
pow and sqrt in math.h
gcc lab3-2.c -lm
put ./a.out
re using the program in same program or diff prog
we use main??
main()
is a funcntion calls by naming and defined
order desn't matter how we define it**
cause main will start first
2 types library func and user defined
user defined have to be defined in the same program or make it a library
call main in main and check
rules for good coiding
1 use meaningful names
2 use indentation helps user understand
3 use whitespaces before varaibles
4 use blank lines
5 don't duplicate tests
Ex if (a%2==0)
else is enough
else if a%2 != 0 is not needed
6 use semicolon more
7 use prenthesis
8 use comments
$ Charc sets in C
  alpha digits special white spaces 
  all will have ASCII values
$ tokens
   reserved words shouldn't be used (lower case) ex goto and volatile
   
$ Rules 
names(vars arrays functions) are case sens ,letter digits and underscor
1st is letter or _
can be of arb length
can't be keyword
case sens
$ constants 
primary
 numeric > int and real
 charc> chrac and str
secondary
 arrays pointers and structs
 no computation using strings
'' is for charc and "" is for string
